the zune database crashing or not loading shouldn't kill the program. It should default back to 'select audio files'
Add logging


MAJOR:
bring in artwork from tags if we are using 'select audio files'
when running 'scan all' it should search the zune marketplace for any matches and notify the user if any are found
