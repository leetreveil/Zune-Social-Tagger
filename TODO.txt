integrate core with gui and rename ZuneSocialTagger.GUI to ZuneSocialTagger

PROBLEM: because linked / unlinked statuses are persisted to file an album could be become linked and zst wont pick it up until it's refreshed

should have the blank artwork image showing while images are loading

MAJOR:
when running 'scan all' it should search the zune marketplace for any matches and notify the user if any are found
