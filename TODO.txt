should be able to cancel/rerun scan all

handle folder path not being available if it no longer exists (select audio files) (vista/7)

the zune database crashing or not loading shouldn't kill the program. It should default back to 'select audio files'

Add logging

Improve search filtering, currently you have to type the first letter of the artist so typing "clash" wouldn't find "the clash"


MAJOR:
Needs the ability to update .m4a files
when running 'scan all' it should search the zune marketplace for any matches and notify the user if any are found
