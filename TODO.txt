should be able to cancel/rerun scan all

handle folder path not being available if it no longer exists (select audio files) (vista/7)

the zune database crashing or not loading shouldn't kill the program. It should default back to 'select audio files'

when you select audio files if one cannot be read it shouldn't prevent all of them from being read

Add logging


MAJOR:
Needs the ability to update .m4a files
when running 'scan all' it should search the zune marketplace for any matches and notify the user if any are found
